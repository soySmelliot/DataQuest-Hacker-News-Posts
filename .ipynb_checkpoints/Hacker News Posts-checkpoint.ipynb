    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze a data set containing submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is a site started by startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories known as \"posts\" are voted and commented upon. Hacker news is very popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be working with can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). It has been reduced from from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing submissions that did not receive any comments and randomly sampling from the remaining posts. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| `id` | The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post |\n",
    "| `title` | The title of the post |\n",
    "| `url` | The URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL |\n",
    "| `num_points` | The number of points the post received (upvotes - downvotes) |\n",
    "| `num_comments` | The number of comments the post received |\n",
    "| `author` | The name of the account that made the post |\n",
    "| `created_at` | The date and time the post was made (US Eastern Time) |\n",
